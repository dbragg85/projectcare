# Deploying Project CARE to projectcare.life

## Option 1: Netlify (Recommended - Easiest)

### Method A: Drag and Drop (Quick Start)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
2. Drag and drop your entire project folder onto Netlify's dashboard
3. Your site will be live immediately with a temporary URL (e.g., `random-name.netlify.app`)
4. Go to **Site settings** → **Domain management** → **Add custom domain**
5. Enter `projectcare.life`
6. Netlify will give you DNS instructions - add the CNAME or A record to your domain provider
7. Wait for DNS propagation (usually 5-30 minutes)

### Method B: Git Integration (Better for updates)
1. Create a GitHub repository and push your code
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) → **Add new site** → **Import an existing project**
3. Connect your GitHub account and select the repository
4. Build settings:
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: `.` (root)
5. Click **Deploy site**
6. Add custom domain `projectcare.life` in domain settings
7. Update DNS records as instructed

## Option 2: Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
2. Click **Add New Project**
3. Import from Git or drag and drop the folder
4. Configure:
   - Framework Preset: **Other**
   - Root Directory: `.`
5. Click **Deploy**
6. Go to **Settings** → **Domains** → Add `projectcare.life`
7. Update DNS records as instructed

## Option 3: GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push your code to the `main` branch
3. Go to repository **Settings** → **Pages**
4. Source: **Deploy from a branch** → select `main` → `/` (root)
5. Your site will be at `username.github.io/repo-name`
6. To use custom domain:
   - In Pages settings, add `projectcare.life` under Custom domain
   - Create a file named `CNAME` (no extension) with just `projectcare.life` inside
   - Update DNS: Add a CNAME record pointing to `username.github.io`

## DNS Configuration

Once you choose a hosting provider, you'll need to update your DNS at your domain registrar (where you bought `projectcare.life`):

**For Netlify:**
- Add a CNAME record: `@` → `your-site-name.netlify.app`
- OR add A records for root domain (Netlify will provide IP addresses)

**For Vercel:**
- Add a CNAME record: `@` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`

**For GitHub Pages:**
- Add a CNAME record: `@` → `username.github.io`

## SSL/HTTPS

All three services provide free SSL certificates automatically once DNS is configured. It may take a few minutes to activate.

## Notes

- The `netlify.toml` file is already configured for Netlify
- Make sure `Project CARE.png` is in the same directory as `index.html`
- Test the site after deployment to ensure all images load correctly
